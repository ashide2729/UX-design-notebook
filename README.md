The repository contains documentation to UX design understanding and process. This document will help you understand what a UX design is and how to bring out a great UX design.

UX design:
First before we get into the details you should know that there are developers, there are designers and then there are design minded developers.
If you have got the point in the above statement then let’s get started,
UX(User Experience) as the name conveys is with respect to the user. The ultimate goal of UX is to make the user happy to use the app, make the user engage more with the app and be enthusiastic about it.
Now first we should know the difference between UI and UX, UI is the visual part but when visual and non-visual comes together it is UX. Simple and sweet.
For example : Data sourced from many sources presented in a less but most appropriate manner to the user
UX can be conveyed as a mix of UI, Engineering and Interactive design.
Now creating a good UX is not just one or two guys job instead it is a job of all the people involved whether it be a developer or a designer.
Now let’s study UX by taking an example into consideration:
Suppose you have a login page to design now you might think of many fields to be inputted by the user to sign in or sign up but there is a UX way where:
o	Have option to sign from different social ids instead of creating a new user(one click sign in)
o	Have few fields if required maybe like phone number
Now while doing this example few of the people might have thought many different ways and it’s good but before approaching it always remember “Avoid the mistake of thinking too much details” 
Here are a few steps to approach UX:
o	First write down everything on paper, board, online canvas
o	Define the task or purpose of the user of using the app
o	Then define the steps the user will go through
o	Check the steps what is required in them ex : If you really need a sign in or want other option too (Lo res wireframing)
So far you have learnt about the basic definitions and approach let’s study what will actually help you stand out as a better UX designer than others:
User centered design
Your UX design should be user centered meaning:
Think of features a user might be interested in 
Avoid these biases:
	Preference bias(Don’t bias your design with what you will like)
	Approach bias(The bias of approaching the app or the context)
Create personas(think of a person other than yourself and think how that person will use the app ) and then create the features list and think of them in real use case to avoid those debate room conflicts over all the features being equally cool
Personas are created of real world users using the approach of UX research
Studying users, their preferences & behavior 

Let’s talk in a narrower perspective of mobile design but in a broader manner.
Mobile design:
	Mobile is different from web and desktop
	Study the constraints of a mobile user
		Finite data and battery
		Divided attention
		Handling of phone
		Screen size
Combine mobile persona att. and user persona att.
	Make sure to consider Reflow(how the screen size differs from phones, tv, tablet etc.)
		Micro
		Macro	
	Work with the context the user uses the app and not beyond
	Use services like Google play services to help get the context of the user
	Make the most of the available features but reasonably
